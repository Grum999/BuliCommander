# Buli Commander :: Release 0.9.0b [2022-XX-XX]

## File panels

### Grid view mode - Smooth thumbnail scroll

[Feature request #5](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliCommander/issues/5)

Improve thumbnail scroll, taking in account:
- Current thumbnail size 
- Current available view height

This ensure for big thumbnail on small view to get a smaller scroll, and for small thumbnail on a large view, to have bigger scroll.


## User Interface

### Implement *Override Krita Welcome Screen "Open file" dialog*

[Feature request #6](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliCommander/issues/6)

This option allows to replace Krita's "Open file" dialog with Buli Commander.

- "Open file" action from _Welcome screen_
