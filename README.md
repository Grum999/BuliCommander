# Buli Commander

An [orthodox file manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Orthodox_file_managers) plugin for [Krita](https://krita.org).


## What is Buli Commander?
*Buli Commander* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program).


Initially, my idea was to implement my own open dialog box to replace the default one from [Krita](https://krita.org),
because the default one doesn't satisfy me:
- No file preview
- No file information

As I'm used to work with orthodox file managers like [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) and
[Krusader](https://krusader.org/), I finally decided to implement my own open dialog box in this way.


## Disclaimer
> **Please note that current version is a pretty early preview version**

While *Buli Commander* version is not published under version 1.0.0, please take in consideration the following points:
- There's bugs, some of them are known, some are not (yet?) known
- Implementation can be rewritten, so a bug can disappear naturally on next version... or not :-)
- All functionalities are not yet implemented or not yet fully implemented
- Current user interface and current functionalities are not definitive and can be changed on next version

>Please also note that, as plugin is not yet finished and **not yet fully tested**, it's not recommended to use it on a
>[Krita](https://krita.org) installation used for a production workflow: test it/use it on a testing installation
